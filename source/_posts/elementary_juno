I've been us Elementary OS as my primary laptop OS over a year and have been [wrote some posts](https://blog.gasolin.idv.tw/2018/02/25/advanced_elementary_os_usage/) for it.
I Upgrade to Juno at December last year. Juno is based on Ubuntu 18.04, most things works fine and less things need for tweaking.

Here's my setup for XPS 13-9360

## 1. Package installer

1. Insatll `Eddy` on AppCenter instead of `sudo apt install gdebi`
2. essentials

```sh
sudo apt install software-properties-common git
```

##　2. Setup Fonts

```sh
$ apt instsall firacode
```

## 3. Pairing Bluetooth Mouse and Make right click works for Touchpad

The Bluetooth connectoin is basically stable

To make right click works for Touchpad

Settings >　Mouse & TouchPad, select Physical Click from `MultiTouch` to `TouchPad`

## 4. Saving Power

tlp is a good tool for auto power management and now it can be installed through the default repo.

```
sudo apt-get install tlp
sudo tlp start
```

5. Auto adjust color temperature

It's build-in now.

Go Settigns > Monitor > Night Light to toggle it on.

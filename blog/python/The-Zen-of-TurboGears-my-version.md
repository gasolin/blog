The Zen of TurboGears, by Fred Lin

Keep simple things simple and complex things possible
Give defaults while you give choices 
Give choices while the one obvious way depends

Make it work 
Make it right 
Make it fast

Pythonic is better than domain specific
Easy configuration is clear than convention
Integration counts
Batteries included rocks
Flexibility flow ideas into each part of code 

keep data in Model and seperated logic from Template 
Widgets are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

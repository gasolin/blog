What is jythonroid

Jythonroid is a project for porting jython on Android platform. Created by ClassFoo.

Jythonroid is for console-only at this time. It means oneday Android has console/terminal app in device, you could use jython on real android phone. (or please point me if there's an exist console/terminal app for Android)

Jythondroid was worked on m5-build but outdated when 1.0 SDK comes out. Now Jythonroid (branch) works on 1.0 SDK &amp; Android Emulator again. Since there's no GUI yet, you could checked out the code, run the emulator(install in emulator), and use adb shell on PC to try jythonroid.

I just try the TurboGears Identity Management function, 

Thanks Jeff,  the TurboGears  identity system is pretty slick :-)

I think we need a more clear and "actionable" document, so I "fire up" and modify the IdentityManagement doc on trac.

Updated 20060410:
Now the document has been the Turbogears official document, 
get it [here](http://www.turbogears.org/preview/docs/identity/index.html).

I got my Dell XPS 13 (9343) for a while and decide to install Ubuntu 15.10 as duel boot.

By following the [guide](http://hgdev.co/install-ubuntu-15-10-on-the-dell-xps-13-9343-2015-a-complete-guide/) its pretty easy to get a Ubuntu environment.
To setup my daily develop environment, I take the [foxbox setup script](https://github.com/gasolin/foxbox/blob/master/scripts/setup_ubuntu_14_04.sh) for 14.04 and everything works fine.

So for windows user who want develop FirefoxOS gaia with real device, I recommend you try [foxbox](https://github.com/gasolin/foxbox/) first. If you have more commitment, install the Ubuntu. With duel boot you can keep windows and have a more developer friendly environment to develop connecting devices.

MIPL Mobile IPv6 for Linux is an implementation of Mobility support in IPv6\. Mobility support allows a mobile device to be tracked as it migrates between networks or even ISPs, allowing packets to be forwarded to where the device is currently located.

Download the stuff at these locations:

[mipv6-2.0-rc2.tar.gz](http://mobile-ipv6.org/software/download/mipv6-2.0-rc2.tar.gz) (Latest **USER SPACE** part)

[mipv6-2.0-rc2-linux-2.6.8.1.patch.gz](http://mobile-ipv6.org/software/download/mipv6-2.0-rc2-linux-2.6.8.1.patch.gz) (Latest **KERNEL** part)

Remember, you need both of those. First is the user space daemon, and the other is a patch to enable MIPv6 in the kernel. INSTALL and INSTALL.kernel should get you started.

The NEPL NEMO Platform for Linux is a NEMO implementation based on the MIPL 2 architecture.

It aims to be fully RFC 3963 compliant supporting both implicit and explicit mode signalling.
Version 0.1 only supports static routing between the HA and MR.
